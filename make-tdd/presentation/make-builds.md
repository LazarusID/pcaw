# Building Arduino Programs with Makefiles

---
## What Does It Take

 - A Native Build Tool (make)
 - A cross compiling tool chain
 - avrdude
 - Patience

---
## Getting the Tools

Two Options
 - Install avr-gcc toolchain for your OS
 - Cheat and steal it from Arduino
---
## OMG Makefiles

 - WTF, My CS Classes Never Covered This?
 - Actually Simple
 - Basically shell scripts with dependency management
---
## A Couple of Examples

  - A Simple Makefile -> ../mock/Makefile
  - OMG WTF -> ../src/Makefile
