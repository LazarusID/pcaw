# Makefiles and TDD

Wherein I discuss how we can build code for Arduinos using common C development tools.  Also how to use Test Driven Development to make our development easier and more reliable.

## Makefiles

The humble Makefile, long the bane of the inexperienced C developer, can be tamed and made to serve our purpose for writing Arduino programs.

  - What tools you'll need
  - How to crib together a basic Makefile
  - Plagiarism for Fun and Profit, a.k.a. learning from the mistakes of others
  - Automating updates to the Arduino

## Test Driven Development

Automated tests speed your development by reducing the number of rabbit holes you have to chase down and eliminating debugging.

  - Mocking out system calls
  - Testing meaningful things
  - Abstracting logic to improve testability and reduce complexity
