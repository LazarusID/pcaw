# Arduino Framework

This folder exists to build and act as a workspace for the Arduino framework.  You can use any other embedded framework with the project by changing this folder to build that framework instead of the Arduino framework.

If you change the framework be certain to update linking options in `/src` to reflect the new library you have built.
